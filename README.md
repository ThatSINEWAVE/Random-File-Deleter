# Random File Deleter

This repository contains a small script (`script.bat`) intended to run at startup and delete a randomly chosen file at intervals ranging from 1 to 10 minutes. The script targets files with a specific extension, which can be modified by the user. A PowerShell script (`start_script.ps1`) is included to facilitate running the batch script in the background at startup.

## Features

- **Random Interval Execution**: Deletes a file at a random interval between 1 and 10 minutes.
- **Customizable File Targeting**: Users can specify the file extension of the files to be targeted for deletion.
- **Startup Execution**: Includes a method to run the script at system startup, ensuring the random deletion process begins automatically.

## Setup

1. **Modify File Extension**: Open `script.bat` and change the `file_extension` variable to target the desired file type. The default is set to `.prproj`.
    ```batch
    set "file_extension=.your_extension_here"
    ```
2. **Configure Startup Task**: Use `start_script.ps1` to run `script.bat` at system startup. This can be done by scheduling a task in the Task Scheduler to run `start_script.ps1`.

## Usage

After setting up the script and configuring the targeted file extension, the script will automatically run at the specified intervals, deleting a randomly selected file with the specified extension in the script's directory.

### Starting the Script Manually

To start the deletion process manually, simply run `start_script.ps1` using PowerShell, which will execute `script.bat` in the background:
```powershell
.\start_script.ps1
